It’s in its early development stage, where I’m designing its modular logic and groundwork for a custom-trained AI model. 
My goal is to create a fully personalized assistant that understands natural language, adapts to user behavior, and executes real-world tasks intelligently.`,

    details: `⚙️ Core Tech: Python, SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3, Custom LLM (in progress)
🚀 Focus: Local inference, modular architecture, personalized interaction logic
